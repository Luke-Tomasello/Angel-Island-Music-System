/* Scripts\Engines\AIMusicSystem\MusicBox\MusicBox.Commands.cs
 * Changelog
 *  11/8/26, Adam (2026 modernization, 10/29/26 to 11/8/26)
 *      The speech commands as one table: each command's words, help line, gates and handler, so the help list and
 *      TextCommand() can't disagree with the commands. Command words match in any case. Play by title: staff (GM and
 *      up, was Administrator) hear any track, and the one who submitted a pending track hears it; What says "pending".
 *      Add alone is Submit (the target cursor); Add with a song name still puts a removed song back. Repeat plays the
 *      song from a fresh copy (PlayContext.Replay; the copy it played is deleted once its song has ended).
 *      Split from MusicBox.Speech.cs; its history before 10/29/26 is in MusicBox.cs.
 *      Portable AIMS: Test Center (staff may buy music there) goes through AimsHost.
 *      'who': the box speaks as always; whoever may use 'find' also gets find's line for the track as a system message
 *      (owner, serial, hash code, and the shard's note: AimsHost.TrackNote).
 *      'list <words>' lists the tracks whose titles have every word ("I couldn't find any tracks for ..." when none
 *      do); Help shows it with 'list by <composer>'.
 *      'status': the composer's songs (waiting for review, approved, remastered, or not approved with the reason and
 *      staff's note: MusicLibrary.ComposerSongs), then what 'sales' says. 'status pending|approved|rejected' (also
 *      waiting, published, denied) lists only those songs, without the sales lines.
 *      'new' (also "what's new", "whats new", "what is new", "anything new", "new releases", "new music", in any case):
 *      the latest releases, newest first, each with when it was approved or remastered: the last 7 days, at least the 5
 *      most recent, at most 10 lines ("...and N more"). "what's new" was the What command (the song playing); 'new' was
 *      every song of the last 8 days, unsorted, undated, and "There are no new releases" in a quiet week.
